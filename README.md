## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is an unofficial repository to run Stata using Docker. You must have the license code. Otherwise, you can't execute Stata because the `stata.lic` file is not attached in the Docker images.

## Images
There is one image. To see my Docker repositories, visit [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/eboisseausierra). Use the following Docker commands to pull the images:

```bash
# only Stata
docker pull eboisseausierra/base-stata:latest
```

## Too lazy to install Docker?
No worries, you can execute this via [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) for both public and private repositories. Its default setup has Docker installed. Understanding Docker commands may be helpful, though you can just copy and paste my snippets above.
